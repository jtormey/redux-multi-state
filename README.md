# Handling Multiple Redux States

Concept: handle multiple states at the root level, without requiring changes in the implementing application.

## Project

`frontend/` contains the app that would implement this multi-state concept.

`src/` contains the supporting modules that enable multi-state.

## Running

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` - runs webpack and watches for changes
3. `npm run serve` - starts serving files on :8080
